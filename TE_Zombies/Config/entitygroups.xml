        Sleeper Volume Entity Groups

        These are used by the sleeper volume spawners, defined in gamestages.xml.
        By convention, they are named npc[Association][Classification]GroupGS[01|50|100|200|400|800],
        where Association is a larger category (like a faction),
        and Classification is a smaller category within that association (like ranged vs. melee).
		The numbers represent the maximum gamestage for that group - see gamestages.xml.
        This should make them easier to target with XPath.

		The associations and classifications of the NPCs in these groups are not enforced by the game.
		You can place military NPCs in the military group, even if they are in the whiteriver faction.
		(In fact, you could even put them in the friendl animals group, though you shouldn't.)

		Since entity groups cannot be empty, sample NPCs are added to all groups:
		
		* Harley NPCs are added to the bandit, enemy, and deco trap groups.
		
		* Nurse and Baker NPCs are added to the whiteriver, friendly, and deco rescue groups.
		
		* For humanoid groups without appropriate sample NPCs, these sample NPCs are added at
		  a very low probability, to make their chance of spawning insignificant when other NPCs
		  are added to the entity groups.
			* Nurses are added to the non-enemy entity groups:
				* Military
				* Vault
				* Deco Trader
			* Harleys are added to the enemy entity groups:
				* Duke
				* Whisperers
				* Mech
				* Fantasy
			(Note: enemy and non-enemy are not fixed terms - modders can make them whatever
			alignment they want. If they do, they should remove inappropriate sample NPCs.)
		
		* The NPC fox and vanilla timid animals are added to the friendly animals groups.
		
		* Vanilla hostile animals (live only, no zombies) are added to the enemy animals groups.
		  
		* Enemy animals are added to the Arachnids group, with very low probabilities.

		* Vultures (regular and radiated) are added to the Flyers group, with very low probabilities.

		The entity probabilities are gamestaged, even when they spawn at a low probability.

		All probabilities have only one significant digit.

		This is designed so that NPC pack creators can target those probabilities when inserting their own NPCs.
		
		* For Core NPCs that are in appropriate entity groups, target their probabilities, and match them.

			Example: You have a bandit NPC with a weapon that is the general equivalent of a machete.
			Match the Harley NPC armed with a machete, and spawn in with the same probability:
			<insertAfter xpath="//entitygroup[starts-with(@name, 'npcBandit')]/entity[@name='npcHarleyMachete' and @prob="'0.1']">
				whateverMyBanditIsNamed, 0.1 
			</insertAfter>
			<insertAfter xpath="//entitygroup[starts-with(@name, 'npcBandit')]/entity[@name='npcHarleyMachete' and @prob="'0.2']">
				whateverMyBanditIsNamed, 0.2 
			</insertAfter>
			...etc.

		* For Core NPCs that are not in appropriate entity groups, target their probabilities,
		  but make your own NPCs 100x their probabilities.

			Example: You have a Mech NPC with a weapon that is the general equivalent of a pistol.
			Match the Harley NPC armed with a pistol, and spawn in with 100x their probability:
			<insertAfter xpath="//entitygroup[starts-with(@name, 'npcMech')]/entity[@name='npcHarleyPistol' and @prob="'0.001']">
				whateverMyMechIsNamed, 0.1 
			</insertAfter>
			<insertAfter xpath="//entitygroup[starts-with(@name, 'npcMech')]/entity[@name='npcHarleyPistol' and @prob="'0.002']">
				whateverMyMechIsNamed, 0.2 
			</insertAfter>
			...etc.
